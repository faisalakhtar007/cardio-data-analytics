# Heart Attack Risk Analysis: Youth vs Adults in Pakistan

# Project Overview
This project analyzes heart attack (cardiac arrest) risk among youth (<40 years) and adults (40+ years) in Pakistan using Python-based data analysis and visualization.
The objective is to assess whether younger individuals show early cardiovascular risk patterns traditionally associated with older populations, and to emphasize the importance of early prevention and public-health interventions.


# Objective

To compare cardiac arrest prevalence, lifestyle risk factors, and clinical health indicators between youth and adult populations in Pakistan, and to identify early warning signals of cardiovascular disease among younger individuals.

# Summary

The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart health dataset representing patients from Pakistan. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and enhanced through feature engineering, including age-group classification and binary encoding of cardiac arrest outcomes.

The analysis examines:

Cardiac arrest rates by age group

Lifestyle risk factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension)

Clinical indicators (BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate)

Gender-based trends

Correlation between health indicators and cardiac arrest

Results indicate that youth populations exhibit non-trivial cardiac arrest risk, with lifestyle and clinical risk factors comparable to adults. These findings suggest that cardiovascular prevention strategies should target younger populations as well.

# Tools

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Key Insights

Youth (<40) show comparable cardiac arrest risk to adults

Smoking, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent across age groups

Clinical indicators suggest early cardiovascular stress in younger individuals

Early screening and prevention are critical
